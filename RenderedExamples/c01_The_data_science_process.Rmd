# Note 3: 
#   Create the confusion matrix. 

# Note 4: 
#   accuracy 
#   confusion matrix 
#   Overall model accuracy: 73% of the 
#   predictions were correct. 

# Note 5: 
#   precision 
#   confusion matrix 
#   Model precision: 76% of the 
#   applicants predicted as bad really did 
#   default. 

# Note 6: 
#   recall 
#   confusion matrix 
#   Model recall: the model found 14% of 
#   the defaulting loans. 

# Note 7: 
#   false positive rate 
#   confusion matrix 
#   False positive rate: 2% of the good 
#   applicants were mistakenly identified as 
#   bad.
