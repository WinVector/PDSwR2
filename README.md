# Example code and data for "Practical Data Science with R" 2nd Edition by Nina Zumel and John Mount.


We are very proud to present early access to our book [*Practical Data Science with R 2nd Edition*](https://www.manning.com/books/practical-data-science-with-r-second-edition).

This is the book for you if you are a data scientist, want to be a data
scientist, or want to work with data scientists. This is a good "what
next" book for analysts and programmers wanting to know more about
machine learning and data wrangling.
[![PracticalDataScienceCover](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NewImage-3.png)](https://www.manning.com/books/practical-data-science-with-r-second-edition)


Our goal is to present data science from a pragmatic, practice-oriented
viewpoint. The book will complement other analytics, statistics, machine
learning, data science and R books with the following features:

-   This book teaches you how to work as a data scientist. Learn how
    important listening, collaboration, honest presentation and
    iteration are to what we do.
-   The key emphasis of the book is process: collecting requirements,
    loading data, examining data, building models, validating models,
    documenting and deploying models to production.
-   We provide over 10 significant example datasets, and demonstrate the
    concepts that we discuss with fully worked exercises using standard
    R methods. We feel that this approach allows us to illustrate what
    we really want to teach and to demonstrate all the preparatory steps
    necessary to any real-world project. Every result and almost every
    graph in the book is given as a fully worked example.
-   This book is scrupulously correct on statistics, but presents topics
    in the context and order a practitioner worries about them. For
    example we emphasize construction of predictive models and model
    evaluation and prediction over the more standard topics of summary
    statistics and packaged procedures.
