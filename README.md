# Example code and data for "Practical Data Science with R" 2nd Edition by Nina Zumel and John Mount.


We are very proud to present early access to our book [*Practical Data Science with R 2nd Edition*](https://www.manning.com/books/practical-data-science-with-r-second-edition).

This is the book for you if you are a data scientist, want to be a data
scientist, or want to work with data scientists. This is a good "what
next" book for analysts and programmers wanting to know more about
machine learning and data wrangling.
[![PracticalDataScienceCover](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NewImage-3.png)](https://www.manning.com/books/practical-data-science-with-r-second-edition)


Our goal is to present data science from a pragmatic, practice-oriented
viewpoint. The book will complement other analytics, statistics, machine
learning, data science and R books with the following features:

-   This book teaches you how to work as a data scientist. Learn how
    important listening, collaboration, honest presentation and
    iteration are to what we do.
-   The key emphasis of the book is process: collecting requirements,
    loading data, examining data, building models, validating models,
    documenting and deploying models to production.
-   We provide over 10 significant example datasets, and demonstrate the
    concepts that we discuss with fully worked exercises using standard
    R methods. We feel that this approach allows us to illustrate what
    we really want to teach and to demonstrate all the preparatory steps
    necessary to any real-world project. Every result and almost every
    graph in the book is given as a fully worked example.
-   This book is scrupulously correct on statistics, but presents topics
    in the context and order a practitioner worries about them. For
    example we emphasize construction of predictive models and model
    evaluation and prediction over the more standard topics of summary
    statistics and packaged procedures.

In support of [*Practical Data Science with R 2nd Edition*](https://www.manning.com/books/practical-data-science-with-r-second-edition)
